# Automata_Logic
@Aditya Neeraje's Learner Space project inspired this. Don't know if I should thank him for opening doors to newer concepts or blame him for opening the gates to hell

On a serious note, things done under this project
<ul>
  <li>Read and understood (tried to) a paper by Michael Rabin and Dana Scott (in 1959) on <b>Finite Automata and their Decision Problems</b> </li>
  <li>Understood related concepts such as satisfiability, CNF, DPLL algorithm and Conflict Driven Clause Learning</li>
  <li>Finally, coded up DPLL and CDCL based SAT solvers to handle 2-CNF formulae</li>
</ul>
